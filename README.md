# Heart Attack Prediction Project

## Introduction
Heart disease is a significant health issue, with approximately 805,000 people suffering from heart attacks each year in the United States alone. This project aims to utilize methods and techniques learned from the CDS GA 1001 class to analyze data, build predictive models, and improve patient outcomes.

## Project Learnings
This project has provided valuable opportunities to apply various data science techniques, including data collection, data preprocessing, inference, and machine learning. Techniques such as cross-validation, hypothesis testing, and dimensionality reduction have been employed to identify patterns and solve real-world use cases related to heart attack prediction.

## Improvements and Conclusions
Based on the project findings, there are several potential improvements and conclusions:

- **Historical Data**: Access to historical data on patients would enhance model performance and generalization, as periodic data updates could improve predictions and treatment decisions.
- **Classified Data**: Obtaining classified data related to heart attacks could provide additional insights and potentially reduce type 2 errors.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Exploring deep learning models could further enhance model performance and prediction accuracy, given the recent advancements in deep learning research.
- **Real-time Data**: The dataset used in this project contains real-time data on patients, which allows for better generalization to real-world scenarios compared to generated datasets.
- **Null Values**: The dataset used in this project does not contain any null values, which saved time on data preprocessing, although outlier handling and other processing functions were implemented.
